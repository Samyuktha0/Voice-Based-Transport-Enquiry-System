# üó£Ô∏è Voice-Based Transport Enquiry System

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Voice-Based Transport Enquiry System** provides a modern, **hands-free** way for users to look up public transport information. Developed as a core project for a **Database Management Systems (DBMS) Course**, this application elegantly combines speech recognition with a robust data backend to deliver instant, accurate transport details.

It‚Äôs designed to transform complex, menu-driven searches into simple, spoken commands.

### ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Voice-Activated Search** | Allows users to speak natural language queries (e.g., "What is the next bus to the airport?"). |
| **Database-Driven Results** | Converts spoken commands into structured **SQL queries** to fetch precise data from the backend. |
| **Modern Architecture** | Utilizes the powerful **MENM Stack** (MySQL, Express, Node, React) for scalability and performance. |
| **Intuitive Interface** | A simple, clean frontend built with ReactJS to minimize friction for the user. |
